# Lane-images

This is a demo of my Ember.Js abilities.  You can upload an image by clicking on the button beside 'Upload your image here', or just use the default catbug one.

You can apply different effects to the image by clicking on them on the right-side pane.  Effects of the same colour are mutually exclusive - you can only have one green one at a time, but you can mix different colours as you please.  Click on the Reset button to remove all of the effects.
